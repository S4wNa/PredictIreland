# Irish Property Price Prediction Project

Welcome to the Irish Property Price Prediction Project! This full-stack web application uses a Machine Learning model to estimate the price of properties based on their characteristics and features an interactive user interface and contact form.

## Features

- **Price Prediction :** Estimates the price of an Irish property based on characteristics such as location, property type, surface area, energy rating (BER), etc.
- **Web interface :** A user interface developed with React makes it easy to enter characteristics and display the predicted price.
- **Contact Form :** Allows users to send messages via a form, processed by the Flask backend, which sends an email.
(Future functionalities envisaged) : Price map, trend analysis.

the website works and the server with the model too but when i deploy it , there a problem with the server anyway here's the front part site: https://predictireland.netlify.app/
